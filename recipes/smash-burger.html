    <h4>Description</h3>
    <p>A burger that's made by smashing two thin beef patties into eachother with cheese in the middle.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>4 (6-inch) squares of parchment paper</li>
        <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
        <li>4 slices of american cheese</li>
        <li>Burger toppings of choice</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat grill and lightly oil the grate. Preheat an iron flat-top griddle until smoking.</li>
        <li>Spread butter on the indside of the buns and toast the flat-top until lightly browned. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls. Do not pack tightly as this will prevent it from smashing properly.</li>
        <li>Place each ball on the flat-top griddle and cover with parchment, to prevent sticking to the spatula. Re-use parchment as needed. Smash each ball with the use of two spatulas or a small skillet.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the meat with salt.</li>
        <li>Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the centers are a light pink color. Flip over and immediately cover 4 of them with cheese. Grill for an additional 15 to 20 seconds.</li>
        <li>Stack the plain patties over the chesse-covered ones and move each stack to a bun.</li>
        <li>Add toppings.</li>
    </ol>

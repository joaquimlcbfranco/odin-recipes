        <h4>Description</h3>
        <p>A burger that's made by smashing two thin beef patties into eachother with cheese in the middle.</p>

        
        <div class="ingredients">
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <p>4 hamburger buns</p>
            <p>2 tablespoons butter</p>
            <p>1 pound ground beef</p>
            <p>4 (6-inch) squares of parchment paper</p>
            <p>Salt (to taste)</p>
            <p>4 slices of american cheese</p>
            <p>Burger toppings of choice</p>
        </div>

        
        <div class="steps">
            <h4>Steps</h4>
                <p>Preheat grill and lightly oil the grate. Preheat an iron flat-top griddle until smoking.</p>
                <p>Spread butter on the indside of the buns and toast the flat-top until lightly browned. Set aside.</p>
                <p>Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls. Do not pack tightly as this will prevent it from smashing properly.</p>
                <p>Place each ball on the flat-top griddle and cover with parchment, to prevent sticking to the spatula. Re-use parchment as needed. Smash each ball with the use of two spatulas or a small skillet.</p>
                <p>Sprinkle the meat with salt.</p>
                <p>Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the centers are a light pink color. Flip over and immediately cover 4 of them with cheese. Grill for an additional 15 to 20 seconds.</p>
                <p>Stack the plain patties over the chesse-covered ones and move each stack to a bun.</p>
                <p>Add toppings.</p>
